In order to allow d-feet to see all tasks, need to change permissions
in /etc/dbus-1/, create a file called system-local.conf
place the contents of system-local.conf into it

this essentially gives the policy user of "pi" full permission to see dbus

to restart d-bus daemon: sudo systemctl restart dbus
